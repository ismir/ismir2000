<p> Interest in music information retrieval (music IR) is exploding.  This is not surprising: music IR has the potential for a wide variety of applications in the educational and academic domains as well as for entertainment. Yet, until now, there has been no established forum specifically for people studying music retrieval. <p>
Building upon research being conducted around the world, the International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval will be the first Music IR Symposium. 
The resulting information interchange will enable scholars to move more quickly towards viable solutions to many problems. The conference will include both invited and submitted papers, plus a panel with live performance of musical examples on the piano. The keynote speaker will be Marvin Minsky, founder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and long-term member of the <I>Computer Music Journal </I>editorial Board.
